  <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
  <br>

  <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson's poetic and philosophical musings on nature, god, humanity and their
  interaction with one another remain potent even 200-years later. Emerson was an intellectual
  leader within the United States in the mid 19th century. His works influenced by his spiritual
  journey through transcedentalism and a devotion to the divine nature within humanity.
  Emerson paints a symbolic and poetic image which follows beauty, nature and spirit through its
  connection with god, the cosmos and the human soul.</p>

  <h3>Favourite Quote:</h3>
  <br>

  <p>"Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house, a world; and beyond its world,
  a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect. What we
  are, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have and can do. Adam
  called his house, heaven and earth; Caesar called his house, Rome; you perhaps call yours, a
  cobler's trade; a hundred acres of ploughed land ; or a scholar's garret. Yet line for line and
  point for point, your dominion is as great as theirs, though without fine names. Build, therefore,
  your own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind, that will unfold
  its great proportions. A correspondent revolution in things will attend the influx of the spirit.
  So fast will disagreeable appearances, swine, spiders, snakes, pests, mad-houses, prisons,
  enemies, vanish; they are temporary and shall be no more seen. The sordid and filths of nature,
  the sun shall dry up, and the wind exhale. As when the summer comes from the south, the snow-banks
  melt, and the face of the earth becomes green before it, so shall the advancing spirit create its
  ornaments along its path, and carry with it the beauty it visits, and the song which enchants it;
  it shall draw beautiful faces, and warm hearts, and wise discourse, and heroic acts, around its
  way, until evil is no more seen. The kingdom of man over nature, which cometh not with observation,
   a dominion such as now is beyond his dream of God, he shall enter without more wonder than the
   blind man feels who is gradually restored to perfect sight.'"</p>
