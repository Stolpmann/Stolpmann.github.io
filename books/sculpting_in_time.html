  <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
  <br>

  <p>Andrei Tarkovsky goes down in history as one of the most influential directors of all time. Andrei
  believed in cinema as high-art a deep expression of life in it's purest form, represented through
  cinematic poetry. His unique and mystical films are steeped in deep philosophical musings on life, art,
  freedom, death and the indivdual struggle against an all-encompassing totalitarianism sponsored by the
  state and the post-enlightenment world. Tarkovsky believed in art as a means in which inspires mankind
  to reach for the ideal, he believed art was meant for a higher spiritual purpose. Through his book he
  explores his own ideal and his perspective on arts purpose and cinemas role in bringing poetry to life
  through what he describes as a "Sculpting in time". Tarkovsky is deeply influenced by the inner-personal
  struggle of man in his inability to harmonize the material and the spiritual within their own lives.
  Tarkovsky's films range from a historical drama of the Russian artist Andrei Rublev to deeply personal
  and autobiographical films such as mirror. Tarkovsky's impression on cinema has yet to seize as the
  brilliant styling's of the great Russian film-maker have yet to be lost in time.</p>

  <h3>Favourite Quote:</h3>
  <br>

  <p>"In this respect, the situation in the West gives us ample food for thought. Incontrovertible democratic
  freedoms exist side by side with a monstrous and self-evident spiritual crisis affecting 'free' citizens.
  Why, despite the freedom of the individual, does the conflict between the person and society exist here in
  such an acute form? I think that the experience of the West proves that freedom cannot be taken for granted,
  like water from a spring that doesn't cost a penny and demands no moral effort from anybody; if that is how
  he sees it, man can never use the benefits of freedom to change his life for the better. Freedom is not
  something that can be incorporated into a man's life once and for all: it has to be constantly achieved
  through moral exertion. In relation to the outside world, man is essentially unfree because he is not alone;
  but inner freedom he has from the start, if only he can summon the courage and resolution to use it,
  accepting that his inner experience is of social significance.
