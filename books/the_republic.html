  <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
  <br>

  <p>The Republic is a magnum opus, it's range and depths of topics are as vast the heavens themselves. Through
  X Books Plato records the great greek philosopher Socrates dialogue with fellow Athenians as they discuss the infinite landscapes of the
   human condition through the allegory of what it would mean to manifest the perfect republic. Within the dialectic
   journeys of the republic, Plato lays out his metaphysical views on the cosmos, and the fractal existence of man within the
     spiritual and material realms. The nature of the dialogues forces the reader to contemplate the deepest of
      metaphysical concerns through the architecting of the kingdom of heave on earth. With the thoughts provoked too deep and
      the brevity of this synopsis to shallow, requires me to reliquinsh the need to summarize
      this work of incredible material and spiritual importance. The foundation of Western civilisation begins and ends
      with Plato.

  <h3>Favourite Quote:</h3>
  <br>

  <p>"Those who entertain such an idle opinion, would do well to meditate on the profound observation of
  Heraclitus, “that polymathy dues not teach intellect” By a legitimate student, then, of the Platonic
  philosophy, I mean one who, both from nature and education, is properly qualified for such an arduous
  undertaking: that is, one who possesses a naturally good disposition; is sagacious and acute, and is
  inflamed with an ardent desire for the acquisition of wisdom and truth; who from his childhood has been
  well instructed in the mathematical disciplines ; who, besides this, has spent whole days, and frequently
  the greater part of the night, in profound meditation; and, like one triumphantly sailing over a raging
  sea, or skillfully piercing through an army of foes, has successfully encountered an hostile multitude of
  doubts; in short, who has never considered wisdom as a thing of trifling estimation and easy access,
  but as that which cannot be obtained without the most generous and severe endurance, and the intrinsic
  worth of which surpasses all corporeal good, far more than the ocean the fleeting bubble which floats on
  its surface. To such as are destitute of these requisites, who make the study of words their sole employment,
   and the pursuit of wisdom but at best a secondary thing, who expect to be wise by desultory application
   for an hour or two in a day, after the fatigues of business, after mixing with the base multitude of mankind,
    laughing with the gay, affecting airs of gravity with the serious, tacitly assenting to every man's opinion,
     however absurd, and winking at folly however shameful and base-to such as these-and, alas! the world is
     full of such—the sublimest truths must appear to be nothing more than jargon and reverie, the dreams of
     a distempered imagination, or the ebullitions of fanatical faith.</p>

  <p>But all this is by no means wonderful, if we consider that two-fold ignorance is the disease of the many.
  For they are not only ignorant with respect to the sublimest knowledge, but they are even ignorant of their
  ignorance. Hence they never suspect their want of understanding; but immediately reject a doctrine which appears
  at first sight absurd, because it is too splendid for their bat-like eyes to behold."</p>
