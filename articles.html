        <li> "If this hypothesis is true, it means that bitcoin is more than merely new money. It is a new driver in the expansion of civilization and will play a bigger role in the future story of humanity than any of us now realize." </li>

        <hr>
        <li> “Long time horizon investors today use real estate or commodities such as gold, oil, precious metals and — increasingly — bitcoin to hedge exposure to geopolitical risk.  What assets would long time horizon investors of the future use to hedge their exposure to heliopolitical risk?”

        <hr>
        <li> “Speculating about universal properties of life and civilization is thus a kind of mirror we hold up to ourselves and our own civilization.  The reflection we see may teach us more about ourselves than it does about aliens.”

        <hr>
        <li>"Central banks are good at curbing demand, not at conjuring supply. Energy and commodities are needed for virtually everything, Russia exports everything, and unlike 1973, it’s not just the price of oil, but the price of everything that is surging. After laying dormant for decades, the fourth price of money is back with a vengeance – the par, basis, and FX -related prices of money are dormant at the moment, but the price level is about to become very volatile and the market is trying to price the price of future money”</li>

        <li>“There is no great and no small</li>
        <li> To the Soul that maketh all:</li>
        <li> And where it cometh, all things are;</li>
        <li> And it cometh everywhere.</li>
        <li> I am owner of the sphere,</li>
        <li> Of the seven stars and the solar year,</li>
        <li> Of Caesar's hand, and Plato's brain,</li>
        <li> Of Lord Christ's heart, and Shakspeare's strain.”</li>

        <hr>
        <li>“The doors of the temple stand open, night and day, before every man, and the oracles of this truth cease never, it is guarded by one stern condition; this, namely; it is an intuition. It cannot be received at second hand... In how many churches, by how many prophets, tell me, is manmade sensible that he is an infinite Soul; that the earth and heavens are passing into his mind; that he is drinking forever the soul of God? ...dare to love God without mediator or veil... cast behind you all conformity, and acquaint men at first hand with Deity...”</li>

        <h5><a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/1848/french_revolution_1848.html">The French Revolution of 1848</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“Nations, like individuals, have different ages; and the principles which rule them have successive phases. The monarchical, the aristocratic, the constitutional, and the republican forms of government, are the expression of the different degrees of maturity in the genius of nations. They require more liberty in proportion as they feel equality, and democracy in proportion as they are inspired with a greater share of justice and love for the people over whom they rule. It is merely a question of time. A nation ruins itself by anticipating the hour of that maturity; as it dishonours itself by allowing it to pass away without seizing it.”

        <li>“Bitcoin's proof-of-work serves as a bridge between the world of atoms and the realm of information. This bridge can be built in one way and one way only: by coming up with information that is so unique, so preposterously unlikely, that certain things had to happen in the real world for this information to appear. The rules of the game and the nature of physical law allow for no other possibility."        </li>

        <h5><a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/history/1848/italy_revolution.html">The Italian Revolution of 1848</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“The existence of "Italy" was denied by the Austrians to the extent that such denial was actually to be enforced through censorship and statutes of law, (although both censorship and laws in this regard were somewhat ineffectually applied). In April, 1847 Metternich wrote something on this theme in a letter to one of his officials:        </li>
        <li style="padding: 10px;font-style: italic; ">"The word Italy is a geographical expression. Though it is a term that slides easily off the tongue, it has none of the political implications which the revolutionaries are trying to attach to it - implications which would threaten the very existence of the individual states which make up the Italian peninsula."</li>

        <h5><a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">Shelling Out: The Origins of Money by Nick Szabo</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“Primitive money was not modern money as we know it. It took on some of the functions modern money now performs, but its form was that of heirlooms, jewelry, and other collectibles. The use of these is so ancient that the desires to explore, collect, make, display, appraise, carefully store, and trade collectibles are human universals – to some extent instincts. This constellation of human desires might be called the collecting instinct. Searching for the raw materials, such as shells and teeth, and manufacturing of collectibles took up a considerable portion of many ancient humans' time, just as many modern humans expend substantial resources on these activities as hobbies. The results for our ancient forebears were the first secure forms of embodied value very different from concrete utility – and the forerunner of today's money.”</li>

        <hr>
        <li>"We wish to create a constitution for Germany, for the whole empire. The call and the authority for this creation lie in the sovereignty of the nation...Germany will be one...Unity she wishes, unity she will have."</li>

        <h5><a href="https://archive.ph/BJpZH">Proof of Work, a pictorial essay</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>"This is why, as earlier mentioned, calling Bitcoin a "virtual currency" is asinine. It's precisely the opposite to the truth: as I once put it to Superintendent Lawsky in an AMA: "which currency sounds more virtual, the one whose supply can be doubled overnight at the stroke of a pen, or the one that requires millions of dollars of electricity to create 25 new units?" (etc. you get the idea; modern fiat currency is absolutely virtual, whether printed on paper or not)."

        <h5><a href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/wittgensteins-money-7cac8d0635cf">Wittgenstein’s Money By Allen Farrington</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“If it did seem like a new money was emerging, I propose it would seem more like it were tracking an evolving and messy narrative than obeying a fixed and clean equation. It would be slow, and it would be sporadic. It would not be the smooth exponential of a hot new social network, because the nature of its “network effects” would frankly be far more complex. It would be, in essence, the erratic and ever-changing spread of a contrarian belief about the nature of money itself. In the short run it would be a (literally) chaotic mess, but in the long run it would tend towards the merits of the belief.”
