                The Doom Loop by Arthur Hayes</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“Unfortunately (but thankfully, if you are one of Satoshi’s disciples), the West’s decision to financially cancel the largest global energy and commodity producer is the biggest advertisement for the existential need of Bitcoin in a sovereign’s currency savings portfolio. The goal of this essay is to examine from a theoretical point of view the issues capital account countries face and their policy options. Hopefully, I am able to fully communicate why Bitcoin deserves a place in a sovereign’s portfolio"

        <hr>
        <li> "'We are shocked,' Yu Yongding, a prominent economist and former adviser to the People's Bank of China, told Nikkei Asia, referring to the freezing of Russia's reserves. "We never expected that the U.S. would freeze a country's foreign currency reserves one day. And this action has fundamentally undermined national credibility in the international monetary system."

        <li> "We examine and explain a proposed softfork upgrade to Bitcoin, OP_CTV (Check Template Verify). This feature would enable users to commit to spending a Bitcoin output, only under certain restricted conditions. The main proponent of this upgrade, Jeremy Rubin, in a bold move, recently announced the imminent release of a new client with OP_CTV activation parameters. We discuss the proposed softfork activation mechanisms with Jeremy, challenging him on some of the most controversial aspects of his proposal."

                Safer custody with CTV vaults</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>"Vaulting is a technique for putting constraints around how bitcoins can be spent. The constraints are designed in such a way to limit the threat of failure (due to key loss or attempted confiscation) during the custody process. Vaults provide safety improvements that are significant to both individuals performing self-custody and institutions securing large amounts of bitcoin on behalf of their customers."

                DOOMED TO REPEAT HISTORY? Lessons from the Crypto Wars of the 1990s</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“In January 1991, Senator Joe Biden inserted new language into the draft of an anti-terrorism bill, expressing a Sense of Congress that electronic communications service providers and equipment manufacturers 'shall ensure that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plaintext contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law.' Although the proposal did not advance, the message to companies was clear: the government was not likely to tolerate communications services offering strong encryption unless they also included 'backdoors' allowing the government to lawfully obtain the decrypted contents of encrypted messages. Meanwhile, within the NSA, discussions began in earnest in 1992 about how the government might permanently address the 'problem' of the widespread use of encryption."
        </li>
        <li>"The murmurings about a possible 'solution' signaled that a major conflict over encryption was inevitable. War was coming."

        <h5><a href="https://plus2.credit-suisse.com/shorturlpdf.html?v=524K-Vvd1-V">THE ELECTRONIC MONEY STANDARD AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A ZERO INFLATION TARGET</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“...to allow negative rates, a CBDC must be interest-bearing, with the possibility of bearing negative rates (Agarwal, and Kimball 2015). An example of this oversight is the high-profile 2021 report on CBDCs to the Group of Twenty prepared by the Bank for International Settlements, IMF, and World Bank, which features the word “interest” only twice, and not even in relation to CBDCs. If CBDCs are not interest-bearing they will be nothing but digital versions of cash—leading to a “digital zero lower bound,” and with large welfare consequences.”

        <hr>
        <li> “From the perspective of the West, and in particular Europe, commodity exports come from the wrong place (the Russian Federation), commodity inventories exist in the wrong place (China), and leverage, in the form of commodity leverage, exists in the wrong place too – at home. The inflationary impulse from this is BAD."

        <li> “Our currency, your problem” is about the rest of the world’s struggle to procure funding and commodities in a currency that at times got very strong. “Our commodity, your problem” is about the rest of the world’s decision to re -think what the right value of their own currency is and what they’re pegged to. “Our commodity, your problem” is not about the rest of the world’s struggle, but rather the U.S.’s struggle with price stability and with other prices of money.

        <hr>
        <li>"Although photography was then in its infancy a "daguerreotype" of one such barricaded street, in rue Saint-Maur-Popincourt, was taken on 25 June, 1848, and subsequently appeared in the press... to become one of the very earliest examples of pictorial journalism!"

        <h5><a href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/the-capital-strip-mine-ec627e9fe40a">The Capital Strip Mine by Allen Farrington</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“I conceive a strip-miner to be a model exploiter, and as a model nurturer I take the old-fashioned idea or ideal of a farmer. The exploiter is a specialist, an expert; the nurturer is not. The standard of the exploiter is efficiency; the standard of the nurturer is care. The exploiter’s goal is money, profit; the nurturer’s is health — his land’s health, his own, his family’s, his community’s, his country’s. Whereas the exploiter asks of a piece of land only how much and how quickly it can be made to produce, the nurturer asks a question that is much more complex and difficult: what is its carrying capacity? (That is: How much can be taken from it without diminishing it? what can it produce dependably for an indefinite time?) The exploiter wishes to earn as much as possible by as little work as possible; the nurturer expects, certainly to have a decent living from his work, but his characteristic wish is to work as well as possible.”

</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>“Bitcoin will be banned, many times, in many places. But a ban is an open admission of practical and moral failure and is arguably the best advertisement of all. A ban is the Berlin Wall; fragments of any ban will one day become souvenirs of the folly and cruelty of repression. Bitcoin doesn’t force anybody to stay. They come, and then they stay, because they want to — because it is both practically and morally superior.”

        <hr>
        <li>“Believe me, the existence of experts and specialists is one of the many calamities of modern age. A comprehensive and general outlook of life and its problems is becoming rarer everyday. Man has become a toy in the hands of one-eyed specialists of the different sciences and professions.”

        <hr>
        <li>“An individual or group communicating under the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” brought Bitcoin to the Internet in 2009. Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.”

        <h5><a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html?chapter_num=1#book-reader">The Use of Knowledge in Society" by F.A. Hayek</a></h5>
        <hr>
        <li>The problem which we meet here is by no means peculiar to economics but arises in connection with nearly all truly social phenomena, with language and with most of our cultural inheritance, and constitutes really the central theoretical problem of all social science. As Alfred Whitehead has said in another connection, “It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”        </li>

After laying dormant for decades, the fourth price of money is back with a vengeance – the par, basis, and FX -related prices of money are dormant at the moment, but the price level is about to become very volatile and the market is trying to price the price of future money”</li>

The monarchical, the aristocratic, the constitutional, and the republican forms of government, are the expression of the different degrees of maturity in the genius of nations. They require more liberty in proportion as they feel equality, and democracy in proportion as they are inspired with a greater share of justice and love for the people over whom they rule. It is merely a question of time. A nation ruins itself by anticipating the hour of that maturity; as it dishonours itself by allowing it to pass away without seizing it.”

        <li>“Primitive money was not modern money as we know it. It took on some of the functions modern money now performs, but its form was that of heirlooms, jewelry, and other collectibles. The use of these is so ancient that the desires to explore, collect, make, display, appraise, carefully store, and trade collectibles are human universals – to some extent instincts. This constellation of human desires might be called the collecting instinct. Searching for the raw materials, such as shells and teeth, and manufacturing of collectibles took up a considerable portion of many ancient humans' time, just as many modern humans expend substantial resources on these activities as hobbies. The results for our ancient forebears were the first secure forms of embodied value very different from concrete utility – and the forerunner of today's money.”</li>

        <li>“If it did seem like a new money was emerging, I propose it would seem more like it were tracking an evolving and messy narrative than obeying a fixed and clean equation. It would be slow, and it would be sporadic. It would not be the smooth exponential of a hot new social network, because the nature of its “network effects” would frankly be far more complex. It would be, in essence, the erratic and ever-changing spread of a contrarian belief about the nature of money itself. In the short run it would be a (literally) chaotic mess, but in the long run it would tend towards the merits of the belief.”
